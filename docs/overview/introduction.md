# Introduction to Nebulae

## What is Nebulae?

Nebulae is a **privacy-focused, federated social media platform** designed to recreate the authentic social networking experience you remember from the early days of social media — before algorithms, before ads, before your personal data became a commodity.

### The Problem We're Solving

Modern social media has become:
- Algorithmically manipulated: You don't control what you see
- Privacy-invasive: Your data is collected, analyzed, and sold
- Engagement-driven: Designed to addict rather than connect
- Centrally controlled: Platforms can deplatform, censor, or change rules arbitrarily

### The Nebulae Solution

Nebulae brings back social media as it should be:

#### 🔒 Privacy First
- Your data stays on your server
- No tracking, no profiling, no data mining
- Email addresses never exposed to remote nodes
- You control who sees your content

#### ⏰ Chronological, Always
- Posts appear in time order
- No algorithm deciding what you should see
- See everything from friends, miss nothing
- Pure, unmanipulated feed

#### 🌐 Federated
- Self-host your own instance
- Connect with friends on other nodes
- Maintain independence while staying connected
- No single company controls the platform

#### 👤 User Control
- Granular privacy settings per post
- Choose what crosses federation boundaries
- Snooze, block, hide — you're in control
- No forced features or UI changes

## Core Philosophy

### Authentic Connections
Nebulae is built around the idea that social media should facilitate genuine relationships, not maximize engagement metrics. There are no likes-counters, no follower counts displayed prominently, no vanity metrics designed to drive addictive behavior.

### Privacy as a Right
Your communications and personal information are yours. Nebulae doesn't collect analytics, doesn't build shadow profiles, and doesn't sell data to advertisers. Email addresses (used as usernames) are never shared with remote nodes — we use PUIDs (Public User IDs) for federation instead.

### Decentralization
No single entity controls Nebulae. Anyone can run their own instance, and instances can federate together while maintaining independence. If you disagree with another node's policies, you can disconnect without losing your data or local connections.

### Transparency
Nebulae is **open source** (AGPL-3.0), meaning you can inspect the code, verify there's no tracking, and even modify it for your needs. The license ensures that even federated instances must share their modifications.

### Self-Hosting Enthusiasts
People who want control over their data and infrastructure.

## What Nebulae Is Not

- **Not a Twitter/TikTok/Snapchat replacement** - Nebulae is focused on private connections, not public broadcasting
- **Not monetized** - No ads, no premium tiers, no upselling
- **Not fire and forget** - Requires basic server admin skills to keep the server up to date and running (though we make it as easy as possible!)
