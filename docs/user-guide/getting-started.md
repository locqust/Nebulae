## Understanding Your Feed

### How the Feed Works

Nebulae uses a **chronological feed** — posts appear in the order they were created. No algorithm, no manipulation, just real-time updates.

### Feed Sources

Your feed includes:
- ✅ Your own posts
- ✅ Posts from friends
- ✅ Posts on your timeline (wall posts)
- ✅ Group posts
- ✅ Event posts
- ✅ Public page updates you follow

### Feed Controls

#### Snooze Friends

Temporarily hide posts from someone:
1. Click the **⋯** menu on any of their posts or via **My Friends**
2. Select **Snooze [name]**
3. User is snooozed for 30 days, or until you Unsnooze - whichever comes first

#### Block Users

For serious issues:
1. Go to the user's profile or **My Friends**
2. Click **⋯** menu
3. Select **Block User**
4. Confirm

Blocked users:
- Can't see your posts
- Can't comment on your content
- Can't tag you
